## :wave: Intros!

Spice Beanery is a cafe menu-theme web app that allow users to add items to their order and be able to see their prices of their order changes dynamically. An authentication feature with multiple login options are also available for users to gain access to the app's inventory management interface to CREATE, READ, UPDATE & DELETE (CRUD) the store items by manipulating the app's database, all in realtime!

The building blocks of this app that influences its main features are React.js, Firebase Auth + Realtime Database, LocalStorage, ES6+ JavaScript, React Transition Groups + CSS3, along with a number of other helpful libraries.

Get into your "hygge"/ "fika" cafe moments with the indulgence of your choice, and leave some nice little feedbacks if you think your time and experience on the app was great! Just don't forget to keep yourself extra comfortable with some of those fluffy cardigans and throws ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚òï :D

You can check out the deployed app right **_[here](https://spicebeanery.netlify.app/ "Spice Beanery")_**.
  
## :pushpin: Project Objectives

* Initial deliverables with wireframes & user stories prior to development.

* Create an app with a tech stack of my choice.

_**(I chose to build a cafe React app with Firebase Auth and Database)**_

* Write well-formatted, named and commented code.

* A documentation introducng and describing the application in detail.

* Deploy the application online through a hosting platform to make it publically accessible. üöÄ

_**(My top 3 options for this were Vercel, Netlify or Heroku)**_
